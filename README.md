## Overview
COLORS (improving COntact prediction using LOw-Rank and Sparse matrix decomposition) is an approach to seperate the signal from the background in the correlation analysis for protein contacts prediction.  In our approach, a correlation matrix was decomposed into two components, i.e., a low-rank component representing background correlations, and a sparse component representing true correlations. Finally the residue contacts were inferred from the sparse component of correlation matrix.
